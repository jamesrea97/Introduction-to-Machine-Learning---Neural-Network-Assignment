# Neural Network
In this assignment, my group and I implemented and optimsied a neural network. More specifcally, I was involved in the task of creating from scratch a Neural Network, defining the different components of each layer.

Included is also some of the tasks that my team and I were given using the buu

## Directions
Please refer to the 'nn_lib.py' for the codebase that creates the Neural Network.


## Architecture
The Neural Network is organised in Layers. Each Layer contains a loss function and an activation function. The Neural Network takes in data, forward propagate and backpropagate to train a model on test data.
